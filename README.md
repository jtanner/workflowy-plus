## To build the extension run:

    $ make

Running `make` will build the extension into the `dist` directory.

## To install in Google Chrome

* Then select `workflowy-plus/dist/` as the extension directory
* Finally, still on the Extensions page, click on "Keyboard shortcuts" and set your desired shortcuts for the **Workflowy Plus** section

  My shortcuts (on a Mac):
